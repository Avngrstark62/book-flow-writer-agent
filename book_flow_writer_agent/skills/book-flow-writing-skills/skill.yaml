  best_practices:
    for_developers:
      - "Provide clear book titles, topics, and goals for best results"
      - "Specify the scope and depth level for appropriate content generation"
      - "Include target audience information for better tone alignment"
      - "Use specific topics rather than overly broad subjects"
      - "Monitor processing time and implement timeout handling (300s recommended)"
      - "Review generated content for topic-specific accuracy"

    for_orchestrators:
      - "Route book writing and long-form content requests to this agent"
      - "Chain with editing or publishing tools for final production"
      - "Consider query complexity for timeout settings (45-300s typical)"
      - "Use with fact-checking tools for accuracy verification"
      - "Implement fallback to chapter-by-chapter generation for time-sensitive needs"
      - "Monitor token usage as multi-crew workflows consume significant resources"
      - "Combine with formatting tools for final book layout"
